        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Kyle, and this is my page to tell you a little about myself.  
        If you'd like to see my resume feel free to download that <a class="" href="resume2023.pdf" 
        download>here</a>. Lately I've been having a blast getting back into coding by learning 
        the various languages of the web in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I'm hoping to find a career utiliziing 
        these skills and growing even more as a developer.<br><br>
        I live in Raleigh, North Carolina with my wife Kaye and my dog Ahri
        (known by most as red dog). On an average week night you can probably find me sitting on 
        the couch with the dog working through a puzzle from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CrackingTheCryptic">
        Cracking the Cryptic</a> and answering questions about my wife's newfound obsession: Pokemon Go. 
        I also love to cook (Indian and Korean especially) and have gotten into homebrewing a variety of beers,
        kombuchas, and meads. <br><br>
        When I'm not in the house you may find me playing disc golf, exploring new restaurants, or dragging my friends 
        to breweries to play board games and grab a beer. As an avid traveler, I'm always keen to take a trip, whether 
        that's a weekend stay in Asheville, or grabbing my passport and jetting off to Tokyo to justify all of the hours 
        in college I spent learning Japanese (まだ練習が必要あるんですが。。。).</p>
